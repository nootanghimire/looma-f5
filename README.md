looma-f5
----

looma-f5, or looma-reloaded is an frontent for looma, the device: which is a mini-computer with projecter as screen, and runs on very low power. It had a usable interface initially (See github.com/looma/looma). 


Why?
---

The major responsibilites are to completely remove python and php from the initial looma project. We are trying to build the complete interface using only HTML/CSS/JS.

Developments
---

1. First Prototype Stage Complete: Able to replicate PDF reading functionality of looma.


Using?
---

I would like to call this stage as `private beta`, but if you want to get your hands dirty: You just need to clone this. Create a sort of server in your computer (does not need to run any code) and then point to the index.html

Easy, huh?
